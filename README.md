## Hi I am Emma
I am a beginner Web Developer currently working at an internship through Indigenous Friends Association. 
Over the past 5 months I have built a strong foundation in HTML and CSS and currently learning JavaScript.

I have always been artistically inclined and love that I can now make my designs a fully functioning website. 

I am always looking for opportunities to grow and love to collaborate with others. 
Feel free to reach me at  redwoodranchdesigns@gmail.com  if you have any questions!
